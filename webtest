        <h1>What he does</h1>
        <p>If you couldn't already tell, his content is based around drinking beverages as fast as possible. I just have to say, he is extremely skilled at it. Just look at the sprite chug. I can barely chug half a can of carbonated drink, and he chugged an entire two litres.</p>
